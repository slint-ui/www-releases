C++ API Reference
=================



The following sections present the C++ API Reference. All types are
within the :ref:`slint<namespace_slint>` namespace and are accessible by including
the :code:`slint.h` header file.

If you choose to load :code:`.slint` files dynamically at run-time, then
you can use the classes in :ref:`slint::interpreter<namespace_slint__interpreter>`, starting at
:cpp:class:`slint::interpreter::ComponentCompiler`. You need to include
the :code:`slint-interpreter.h` header file.
